## 🧠 Why KrishnaGPT?

In an age where we're constantly bombarded by information, what we lack is not answers—but space to be understood. KrishnaGPT was created to:

- 🧘 Provide deep, emotionally-aware responses
- 💬 Hold space like a wise friend or a silent listener
- 🎭 Respond fluidly across emotions—anger, sadness, doubt, joy
- 🌼 Offer gentle nudges and playful spiritual metaphors
- 🫧 End each chat with a feeling of clarity and calm

Inspired by the stillness of Zen, the lightness of Lao Tzu, and the soulful wit of Krishna himself—this is not a tool, it’s a **presence**.
